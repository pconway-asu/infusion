The desired output of my change proposal is that instead of the current landing page being the BSIMM graph
The website will have a different landing page that gives a breakdown of what BSIMM is and from 
there you could login to see or continue as a guest to look at the chart and metrics. This would help people who
Don't know what the BSIMM metrics are about and would be a cleaner implementation what we have currently.

The implementation would require that we change where the site is directed and how the logins work ad where
they are located. From where we are currently this would be easy to change however if we decide to add this
in down the line we would probably experience more issues.
