### Information Radiator ###
I feel that adding a visual aid to the Initiatives page to track the total amount of labor hours estimated to 
complete all activities within each initiative would make a great addition.  This would allow for a top 
down overview purely from a labor and staffing point of view.  The graph could be a simple line graph 
that contains the number of hours required to complete all activities for a given initiative on the y-axis, 
and a date range on the x-axis.
As various activities are added, the amount of labor will be added to the total number for a particular 
activity and vice-versa when activities are completed.  Because the graph will automatically updated 
based on the information provided from each initiative, the only additional work that a user will have to 
do is select the amount of hours predicted when they are creating an activity.
This means that, of course, before implementation, there has to be a small fillable form or drop down 
box implemented on the activity edit page where the user can enter in the amount of labor hours 
predicted.
