	My idea for an addition to the Infusionsoft Security Metrics project is: To add the ability to 
compare the current Infusion soft BSIM metrics to that of other individual companies instead of just 
the average of the entire industry, this would include various charts/graphs to visualize the data. 
Currently the plan is just to compare infusiuonsoft to the industry as a whole but I feel that the 
data would be worth much more if we could compare to specific companies in order to see where each 
company focuses most of their efforts. 
	
	The implementation for this addition I admit would be a bit complicated and therefore should
 be left for a later addition of the project. We would need to add a domain object for specific 
companies as well as the ability to store information on each company in our database. We would also
 have to program the graph to be more dynamic and user friendly. This addition would be a big 
undertaking but if we plan on doing this later on in the project we can program such that the 
addition would not be so difficult.
